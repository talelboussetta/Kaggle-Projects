# Kaggle Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of Kaggle projects! This repository contains various data science and machine learning projects I've worked on, using real-world datasets and Kaggle competitions. Each project demonstrates a unique problem-solving approach, from data cleaning and exploration to model building and evaluation.

## Projects List
- [Energy Consumption Prediction](https://github.com/talelboussetta/Energy-Consumption-Prediction) 
- [Titanic death rate prediction](https://github.com/talelboussetta/Kaggle-Titanic)
- [Supermarket spend Prediction](https://github.com/talelboussetta/supermarket-loyalty-prediction)

## Repository Structure
Each project is stored in its own folder, containing the following:
- **Data**: Any relevant datasets (in `.csv` or `.xlsx` format).
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks or Kaggle Kernels with code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **Results**: The outcomes, including metrics and visualizations.
- **Readme**: A specific readme for each project describing the objectives, methods, and results.

## Getting Started
To get started with any project:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kaggle-projects.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   `cd energy-consumption-prediction`
3. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow along with the steps.
